On June 13, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a pivotal announcement, naming Brian T. Daly as the new Director of the Division of Investment Management, effective July 8. This appointment comes at a crucial time when the investment management industry faces increasing regulatory demands and the need for effective oversight.

Mr. Daly, an industry veteran, brings with him over three decades of experience, having served in notable roles across global law firms and investment management firms.

Moreover, Daly's experience as a founding equity partner at Kepos Capital illustrates his hands-on experience in the investment sector, giving him practical insights that are invaluable for regulatory oversight. This could potentially pave the way for a more pragmatic regulatory landscape where rules are tailored to the realities of managing investment funds.

As the SEC navigates the complexities of modern finance, from technological advancements to evolving investor expectations, Daly's leadership will be critical. His distinguished academic background, which includes a J.D. from Stanford Law School and a notable tenure teaching legal ethics, underscores his qualifications to lead the SEC’s efforts.
