# Bitget to Delist MANTA On-chain Earn Product

Bitget is set to delist the MANTA On-chain Earn product as of September 30, 2025, at 4:00 PM (UTC+8). This move impacts users currently involved in this earning opportunity. The platform will automatically transfer all related assets to your spot account post-delisting, but it's wise to redeem them beforehand if you wish.

To ensure a smooth transition:
- **Check Your Account**: Log into your Bitget spot account and review your asset details.
- **Redeem Assets**: If you prefer to withdraw funds rather than have them transferred automatically, act before the deadline.

Bitgetâ€™s commitment to transparency means staying informed is key. This update underscores the importance of monitoring your assets and engaging with platforms that prioritize user security and information.
