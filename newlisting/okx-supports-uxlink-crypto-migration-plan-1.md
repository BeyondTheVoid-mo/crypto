# OKX Supports UXLINK Crypto Migration Plan

OKX, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has announced its support for the UXLINK crypto migration. With the latest directives from the UXLINK team, this move is set to ensure a smooth transition for all token holders.

### Migration Schedule

- **Pre-Migration Token Holders**: Users who deposited their UXLINK tokens before 4:50 PM UTC on September 22, 2025, will be included in the migration process. This deadline is crucial for ensuring seamless transitions.
  
- **Migration Timeline**: The actual migration will take place from 2:00 AM UTC on September 30, 2025, to 10:00 AM UTC on October 1, 2025. While OKX aims to complete this within the given timeframe, delays may occur due to coordination with UXLINK and other stakeholders.

- **Trading Continuity**: Importantly, UXLINK trading on OKX will continue uninterrupted during this period. Users can trade without any interruptions, ensuring smooth market operations.

### Deposits and Withdrawals Post-Migration

After successful migration, OKX plans to restore UXLINK deposits and withdrawals. A key change is that future deposits must be made using the ERC20 protocol exclusively; no longer will they be supported on the Arbitrum network. Users are advised to ensure correct deposit methods to avoid any potential losses.
