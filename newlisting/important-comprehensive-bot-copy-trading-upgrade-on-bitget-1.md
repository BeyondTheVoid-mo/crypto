# [Important] Comprehensive Bot Copy Trading Upgrade on Bitget

Bitget is gearing up to revolutionize its bot copy trading platform with a major update launching mid-October. This upgrade promises to boost efficiency and user experience, bringing in exciting new features such as automated profit sharing and smart ranking systems.

### Key Highlights

**1. Profit Sharing System**
Strategists can now share profits from their bots with copiers, earning passive income based on customizable ratios of 0%, 10%, 20%, or 30%.

**2. Smart Ranking and Recommendations**
Bots meeting certain criteria will be featured in the "Bot Square," displaying metrics like Profit and Loss (PnL), drawdown, number of copiers, and ROI. Users can also get recommendations based on recent performance.

**3. User-Friendly Operations**
A simple investment process allows users to copy strategies by just inputting their desired amount. Real-time notifications keep copiers informed of any changes made by the strategist.

### Important Notes for Users
Post-upgrade, strategists must publish or view details directly on the website. Some may lose their strategist status; a guide will be available. Currently, functionalities are limited to futures and spot grid strategies under classic account mode.
