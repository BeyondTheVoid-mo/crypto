# Understanding Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) in Bitget Futures Trading

Auto-deleveraging (ADL) is a key risk management mechanism on Bitget's futures trading platform, activated when the Insurance Fund becomes depleted. This process ensures market stability by matching liquidated positions with counterparties based on their ADL scores.

During extreme market conditions, ADL can significantly impact traders' positions. For instance, during an insurance fund dip, users are ranked according to their ADL scores—favoring profitable positions first. The platform then executes these positions at the bankruptcy price without slippage, crediting profits back to the trader’s account balance.

To minimize your risk of being affected by ADL, consider strategies such as reducing leverage, employing strategic hedging, diversifying investments, and staying informed about market trends. Understanding how ADL works can help you make more informed trading decisions.
