# Bybit Launches APEXUSDT Perpetual Contract with 25x Leverage

Bybit has just launched the APEXUSDT perpetual contract, offering traders access to advanced derivatives trading with up to 25x leverage. This new product caters to both individual investors and institutional participants looking to benefit from the dynamic crypto market.

With a variety of key features such as a USDT settlement asset, tick size of 0.001, and maximum leverage of 25%, Bybitâ€™s perpetual contracts provide a continuous trading experience without an expiration date. The introduction of APEXUSDT further diversifies Bybit's offerings, aligning with the growing interest in decentralized finance and derivative trading.

Bybit supports multiple trading strategies including Futures Grid, Futures Martingale, and Futures Combo bots. For instance, grid trading can help capture price fluctuations automatically, while martingale strategies aim to recover losses through doubling positions after initial setbacks. Combining different bots can provide a more holistic risk management approach.

However, while the potential for high returns is significant, leverage trading also carries inherent risks. It's crucial always to start with a clear risk management strategy, utilize stop-loss and take-profit orders, and stay informed about market news and trends.

The APEXUSDT perpetual contract on Bybit represents a significant addition to the trading platform, offering users a new asset class to explore with high leverage. Investors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the contract specifications and potential strategies to optimize their trading experience.
