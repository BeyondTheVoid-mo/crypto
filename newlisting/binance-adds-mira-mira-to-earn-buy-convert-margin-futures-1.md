# Binance Adds Mira (MIRA) to Earn, Buy, Convert, Margin & Futures

Binance has just expanded its platform by adding **Mira (MIRA)** to several services, including Simple Earn, Buy Crypto, Convert, Margin, and Futures. This move is set to offer users more opportunities for investment in this newly listed cryptocurrency.

Explore Mira’s features through Binance’s HODLer Airdrops program, which rewards BNB holders with token airdrops based on their past snapshots of BNB Simple Earn assets or BNB On-Chain Yield balances. You can also buy and sell Mira using various payment methods like VISA, MasterCard, Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Revolut.

Additionally, you can trade Mira via [Binance Convert](https://www.binance.com/en/convert/USDT/MIRA) with no transaction fees shortly after its listing. Mira will also be available as a new borrowable asset in Binance Margin, allowing trading against pairs such as **MIRA/USDT** and **MIRA/USDC**, starting September 26, 2025.

Binance Futures introduces the **USDⓈ-M MIRA Perpetual Contract**, offering up to 75x leverage with a settlement asset of USDT. This contract will be part of Binance’s New Listing Fee Promotion and support Futures Copy Trading within 24 hours of its launch.

Given the volatility of newly listed cryptocurrencies, it's crucial to utilize stringent risk management strategies. Engage in trading only after thorough research and considering your financial situation and risk tolerance.
