# Bitget Adjusts Leverage and Position Tiers for XPLUSDT Futures

Bitget is set to make significant changes to the leverage and position tiers for XPLUSDT perpetual futures, effective September 26, 2025. These adjustments are designed to improve trading experience and better manage market volatility.

### What’s Changing

The new leverage and maintenance margin rates will be as follows:

- For positions between **0~10000 USDT**, the leverage will increase from **50x** to **75x**, with a lower maintenance margin rate of **0.0100**.
- Positions between **20000~30000 USDT** will see their leverage reduced from **20x** to **25x**, and the maintenance margin rate will increase to **0.0200**.

### Important Notes for Traders

1. **Existing Positions**: All current positions will be affected, so it’s advisable to adjust your leverage and position tier accordingly.
2. **Avoid Liquidation**: To prevent liquidation due to higher maintenance margin rates, ensure you top up or adjust your positions before the changes take effect.
3. **Maintenance Margin Ratio**: Some positions may now require more than 100% of the margin to avoid being liquidated.
