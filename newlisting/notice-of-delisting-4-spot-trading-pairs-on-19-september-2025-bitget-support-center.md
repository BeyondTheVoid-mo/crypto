On September 19, 2025, Bitget will proceed with the delisting of four spot trading pairs: **CSTAR/USDT, 0X0/USDT, HIFI/USDT, and BAKE/USDT**. This decision reflects Bitget's commitment to maintaining high standards concerning the quality and security of digital assets traded on its platform.

Bitget conducts regular reviews of listed assets based on several criteria, including trading volume and liquidity, team involvement, community activity, network stability, responsiveness, and negligent behavior. The delisting process will entail several significant changes for users:
- **Suspension of Deposit Services** for these trading pairs.
- Users can withdraw funds associated with the delisted pairs until December 19, 2025, at 10:00 UTC.
- All pending orders related to the delisted pairs will automatically be canceled on the delisting date.
- Any remaining assets in the unified account for the delisted pairs will be moved to the classic account.

To minimize losses and manage portfolios effectively, users should actively oversee any open orders and transfer relevant assets from their unified accounts. The following services will also be impacted:
- **Removal from Copy Trading** for HIFI/USDT and BAKE/USDT.
- **Removal from Spot Trading Bots** for 0X0/USDT, HIFI/USDT, and BAKE/USDT.

The decision to delist these trading pairs reflects Bitget's commitment to maintaining a trustworthy and resilient trading environment.
