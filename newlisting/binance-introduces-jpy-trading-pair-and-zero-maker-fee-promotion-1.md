# Binance Introduces JPY Trading Pair and Zero Maker Fee Promotion

Binance has just expanded its trading options with the introduction of TRUMP/JPY, a new spot trading pair that will be available from October 3, 2025. This move not only caters to the growing demand for fiat trading pairs but also comes with an exciting zero maker fee promotion. 

Take part in this opportunity by trading during the promotion period (from 08:00 UTC on October 3, 2025, to 07:59 UTC on November 3, 2025) and enjoy reduced fees. However, note that only Binance Japan users can deposit or withdraw JPY, while Binance.com users wonâ€™t be able to conduct JPY transactions.
