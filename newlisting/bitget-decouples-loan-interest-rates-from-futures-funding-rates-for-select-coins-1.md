# Bitget Decouples Loan Interest Rates from Futures Funding Rates for Select Coins

Bitget has just taken a significant step in trading flexibility by decoupling loan interest rates from futures funding rates. Starting on September 29, 2025, this change allows users to explore advanced trading strategies with popular cryptocurrencies like USDT, BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL.

### Key Changes
- **Efficient Arbitrage**: Users can now open opposite positions on the same trading pair for funding rate arbitrage. For example, you could simultaneously go long in futures and short in spot margin trading.
- **Trading Pairs Involved**: The cryptocurrencies included are:
  - USDT
  - BTC
  - ETH
  - XRP
  - SOL

### How to Capitalize on the New System
To make the most of this, hereâ€™s what you should do:
1. **Understand Funding Rates**: Get a grasp of how funding rates fluctuate between spot margin trading and futures.
2. **Monitor Interest Rates**: Keep an eye on loan interest rates for spot margin loans as they can affect your profitability.
3. **Use Leverage Wisely**: Ensure to use reasonable leverage to manage risks associated with market volatility.
4. **Be Aware of Liquidation Risks**: Stay informed about potential liquidations due to sudden changes in the market or interest rates.

### Example Operation
Imagine you're trading USDT and wish to take advantage of this new system. You could open a long position in futures while shorting the same amount in spot margin trading, exploiting the differences between funding rates and loan interest rates for profit.

### Advisory
- **Risk Management**: While arbitrage seems like a lower-risk strategy, always conduct thorough research before making trades.

### Conclusion
This new approach by Bitget not only enhances trading efficiency but also opens up exciting opportunities for traders to engage in sophisticated financial strategies. This evolution aligns with the growing demand for flexibility in cryptocurrency trading.
