# Bitget Enhances Liquidation Price and Margin Calculation for Futures Trading

Bitget has taken a significant step to improve the futures trading experience by enhancing the estimated liquidation price and position margin calculation. These updates aim to provide traders with more accurate tools for risk management, essential in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

To get the full technical details of the new algorithm, head over to [Bitget's support article](https://www.bitget.com/en/support/articles/12560603808759). The new calculation method better reflects real-time market values, offering clearer alerts and more informed decision-making.

Moreover, Bitget has revised the position margin calculation logic. Previously, margin was calculated as:
- **Previous Formula:** Position size × average entry price ÷ leverage
- **New Formula:** Position size × mark price ÷ leverage

These changes lead to dynamic available balance calculations, real-time return on equity (ROE) updates, and automatic recalculation for existing positions. To make the most of these new features:

1. Update your Bitget app to version 3.0.0 or above.
2. Check **Futures Account > Position Details** in your app.

Testing the new calculation logic in a demo trading environment before executing real trades is highly recommended.
