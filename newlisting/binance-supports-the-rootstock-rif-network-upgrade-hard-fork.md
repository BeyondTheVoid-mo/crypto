Binance is set to support the Rootstock (RIF) network upgrade and hard fork, effective October 1, 2025. This milestone aims to enhance network performance and user experience. During this period, deposits and withdrawals of RIF tokens will be suspended starting at 16:00 UTC, with the upgrade scheduled for around 17:00 UTC.

Traders can continue to use RIF tokens without any disruptions. Binance will manage all technical requirements to ensure a smooth transition. Once the network is stable post-upgrade, deposits and withdrawals will resume.
