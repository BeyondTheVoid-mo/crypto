# Bybit Introduces USDE/USDT and USDE/USDC for Spot Margin Trading

Bybit, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, is expanding its platform with the addition of **USDE/USDT** and **USDE/USDC** trading pairs for spot margin trading. Starting September 26, 2025, at 6 AM UTC, these new options will offer traders increased leverage and flexibility.

Spot margin trading allows you to borrow funds to trade larger amounts than you own, enhancing your exposure to market movements. Bybit’s Unified Trading Account (UTA) supports up to **10x leverage** on both pairs, making it an exciting addition for strategic traders.

With the introduction of USDE as a trading pair:
- **Increased Trading Options**: Diversify your strategies with these new pairs.
- **Flexible Leverage**: Amplify potential returns while managing increased risk.
- **Unified Trading Account**: Simplify your experience across different cryptocurrency markets.

To get started, log in to your Bybit account or sign up if you haven’t already. Navigate to the Spot Trading section and select USDE/USDT or USDE/USDC. For a deeper understanding of margin trading, explore Bybit’s educational resources:
