# Notice on Regulating Live-Stream Behavior | Bitget Support Center

Bitget has stepped up its game by introducing new regulations for live streaming on Bitget Live, specifically targeting AFK (Away From Keyboard) practices. These changes are aimed at enhancing the interactive and engaging nature of streams while maintaining high standards.

AFK streaming is now defined as a stream where there's no human voice or chat interactions during specified timeframes, which means background music alone won't cut it anymore. To ensure compliance, Bitget has laid out clear penalty rules:

- **1st detection**: A warning will be issued to the streamer.
- **2ndâ€“3rd detection**: The current stream will be cut off with warnings.
- **4th detection and beyond**: Streaming access will be revoked for 3 days. If AFK behavior recurs after resuming, streaming access will be suspended for 7 days; further violations could result in permanent revocation.

For those who feel unfairly treated, an appeal process is available through the official customer service team or Telegram support at @BitgetLiveOfficial. Bitget's goal is to improve stream quality and viewer satisfaction by encouraging more interactive sessions.
