Hana Network (HANA) is set to make its debut on Binance platforms, marking a significant move into the hyper-casual finance space. This new blockchain platform aims to incentivize user engagement through social networks. The official trading launch is scheduled for **September 26, 2025**, with Binance leading as the first exchange to offer HANA on both Alpha and Futures platforms.

**Binance Alpha Launch**: Trading will commence at **11:00 UTC** on September 26th. Meanwhile, **Binance Futures** will introduce a **HANAUSDT perpetual contract** starting at **11:30 UTC** the same day. The leverage offered is up to **50x**, making it an exciting yet risky opportunity for traders.

A special token airdrop has been announced to celebrate the launch. Users can claim their share by utilizing Binance Alpha Points on the [Binance Alpha Events Page](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/detail/12e7f2e555704f9c8e852d1c1afb032a) available through the Binance App between **September 26, 11:00 UTC** and **September 27, 11:00 UTC**.

For investors considering this venture, it's crucial to remain cautious due to the high volatility associated with new cryptocurrencies, particularly in futures markets. Binance advises a thorough understanding of the risks involved before engaging in trades.

Hana Network's entry into these platforms presents a compelling opportunity for those interested in exploring this emerging asset class, backed by Binanceâ€™s robust infrastructure and user base.
