## Key Implications for Traders
- **New Positions**: The revised tier standards will apply to newly opened positions.
- **Current Positions**: Existing positions must comply with the new tiers starting on October 2, 2025. Users are advised to adjust their margins or positions preemptively to avoid liquidation.
- **Trading Bots**: For users utilizing trading bots, positions and leverage exceeding the new parameters may result in terminations. It is recommended to make adjustments or terminate these bots to mitigate potential losses.

## Recommendations for Traders
To ensure optimal trading strategies:
1. Review and adjust your **ASRUSDT** positions before October 2, 2025.
2. Top up your margin if necessary to avoid the increased maintenance margin requirement.
3. Regularly monitor your maintenance margin ratio as it may exceed 100% based on the new adjustments.

## Conclusion
These changes aim to enhance trading security and operational efficiency on the Bitget platform. All traders engaged with **ASRUSDT** futures should be aware of these updates for optimal performance.
