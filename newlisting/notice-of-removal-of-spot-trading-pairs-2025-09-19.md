Fellow Binancians,

Binance is committed to maintaining a high-quality trading environment and has decided to remove certain spot trading pairs due to poor liquidity and trading volume. Starting from **2025-09-19 03:00 (UTC)**, trading on the following pairs will be ceased:

- **NXPC/BNB**
- **HUMA/BNB**

While this may affect specific pairs, users can still trade the base and quote assets on other available pairs. Spot Trading Bots associated with these pairs will also be terminated at the same time.
