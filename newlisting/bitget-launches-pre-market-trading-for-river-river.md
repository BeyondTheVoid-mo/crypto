River aims to create a unique chain-abstraction stablecoin system, connecting assets and liquidity across different ecosystems. By leveraging the omni-CDP stablecoin satUSD, users can earn, leverage, and expand their portfolios.

### What’s Next for Traders?
In this pre-market phase, traders will have the opportunity to:
- Set buy/sell orders ahead of time.
- Lock in prices before the market opens.

#### Delivery Methods
1. **Coin Settlement**: Orders will be fulfilled periodically during the delivery period. Security deposits will compensate if the seller does not have enough tokens.
2. **USDT Settlement**: Orders are executed at the end of the delivery period, ensuring fair trades based on an average index price from the last ten minutes.

### Benefits
Pre-market trading offers several advantages:
- **Liquidity**: Secure asset liquidity in advance before official listing.
- **Price Optimization**: Aim for better pricing by placing orders ahead of time.

For example, buying 10 RIVER tokens at 10 USDT and selling them later at 15 USDT will result in a calculated PnL. Dive deeper into the details and benefits on [Bitget's official page](https://chain-base.xyz/bitget-launches-pre-market-trading-for-river-river).
